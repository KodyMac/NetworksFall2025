This is my project V1 for CS4850 Computer Networks.
It is a simple chat room that includes a client and a server that utilizes sockets. (Done in Python here)
It lets the client program have commands: login, newuser, send, and logout.
The server will run a chat room service and will echoe messages back to the client

V2 will allow multiple clients.
